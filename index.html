  <p>
    The <strong><u>World Wide Web (WWW)</u></strong>, commonly known as the Web, is an information system where
    documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators
    (URLs, such as <a href='https://www.example.com/' target='_blank' title='example domain'>
    https://www.example.com/</a>), which may be interlinked by hypertext,
    and are accessible over the Internet. The resources of the WWW are transfered
    via the <strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</strong> and may be accessed by users by a software
    application called a web browser and are published by a software application called a web server.

    English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first
    web browser in 1990 while employed at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland.
    The browser was released outside CERN in 1991, first to other research institutions
    starting in January 1991 and then to the general public in August 1991. The World Wide
    Web has been central to the development of the Information Age and is the primary tool
    billions of people use to interact on the Internet.
